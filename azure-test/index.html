    <h1>Azure Mini Guides - Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Azure mini guides! In this series, we will help you get started with basic Azure services, focusing on the Azure OpenAI service. We begin with a general introduction to the cloud and cloud concepts, then give you a tour of Azure's portal and its basic building blocks: resources, at which point we give important information regarding costs and budgets. We then shift our focus to OpenAI services, starting with a basic GPT deployment, moving on to retrieval-augmented generation (and its Azure dependencies: storage and AI search), give you an introduction to the API, and finalize with a guide to fine-tuning. 
    </p>

    <p><b>How should I use these mini guides?</b></p>

    <p>
        To avoid overload of information and get you started as soon as possible, each guide is devised to be read in a few minutes. However, we make a trade-off. Instead of giving you the step-by-step instructions, we expect you to have Azure open and do a bit of exploration yourself. We focus on explaining concepts, providing a view of overall organization, and explaining how things work together and depend on each other. This way, if there are any changes in Azure, your learning will be robust, and we won't spend time on tedious self-evident steps like "now write your name on the [Name] field".
