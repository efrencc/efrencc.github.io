    <!-- Document Contents go here-->
    <p>As part of Azure services you may have access to OpenAI resources. Not all subscriptions have access to these resources. Chances are you have access through the University subscription. Otherwise, to apply for access, go <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai" target="_blank">here</a>. There are three main types of resources Azure OpenAI provides: chat, completions, and embeddings. We wonâ€™t go over the details of all of these since Azure already has plenty of documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models" target="_blank">here</a>. We will show you how to create an OpenAI resource, but first, we will address some important points in which you may need clarification. Let's proceed!</p>
