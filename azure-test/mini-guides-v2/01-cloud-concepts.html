    <h1>Cloud Concepts</h1>

    <!-- Document Contents go here-->
    <h2>What is the cloud?</h2>
    <p>The term "cloud" in computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, encompassing storage, processing power, and software applications. Rather than relying on local hardware and infrastructure, users can access these services remotely from cloud service providers' servers. Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, allowing users to access resources on-demand and pay only for what they use.</p>

    <h2>What is Azure Cloud?</h2>
    <p>Azure Cloud managed by Microsoft is a centralized hub for accessing computing resources, storage solutions, networking capabilities, and various other tools essential for modern digital operations. With Azure, users can tap into scalable computing power as needed, eliminating the need for costly hardware investments and allowing for flexible resource allocation based on workload demands. Additionally, Azure offers an extensive selection of services spanning virtual machines, databases, and more.</p>

    <p>Cloud services like Azure operate on a pay-as-you-go model, ensuring that users only pay for the resources they consume. For instance, if you require a temporary server for a brief period, rather than investing a substantial sum upfront to purchase a server, you can opt to provision a server for the required duration. Once your usage is complete, you can simply turn off or terminate the server, halting any further charges to your account. This approach allows for flexibility and cost-efficiency, as users have the freedom to scale resources according to their immediate needs without being locked into long-term commitments or unnecessary expenses.</p>

    <h2>Northwestern Cloud Account</h2>
    <p>For researchers who are planning on using public cloud services we highly recommend requesting a Northwestern Cloud account as the Cloud Ops team and or the Vendor can help support you and provide general monitoring of your account to ensure that proper configuration and help prevent anomalous account behavior. If you already have an existing cloud account, you can transfer it to be under Northwestern to gain discounts and benefits which will be covered next.</p>
