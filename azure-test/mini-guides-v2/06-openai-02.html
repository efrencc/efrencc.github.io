    <h1>Azure OpenAI - Create Your First OpenAI Resource</h1>

    <!-- Document Contents go here-->
    <p>To create a resource click on the “Create a Resource” button in Azure’s Home. You will notice this sends you to the marketplace. Type "openai" in the search bar, the first result should be the Azure OpenAI option (see Figure ##).</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Click “Create" and fill in the fields accordingly. You may not be familiar with the second step, on network security, below we explain what it means.</p>

    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>When you create an OpenAI Resource it will prompt you to configure the network for your Azure AI Services. For a detail explanation of utilizing Virtual Networks and OpenAi Service follow the following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks?tabs=portal" target="_blank">link</a> (see Figure ##).</p>

        <figcaption>Figure ##. When creating an OpenAI resource, you must indicate the network security level.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>You have 3 choices:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>All networks:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This allows access to your resources from anywhere over the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Selected networks:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Here you can select or create a Virtual network which is a range of IP addresses and associated services that are within that range of IP addresses.</li>
            <li>Selecting this option means that your Azure AI Service will only be allowed to communicate to other endpoints that are within the same Virtual Network.</li>
            <li>To learn more about the importance of Virtual Networks and additional details see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Disabled:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Blocks all network access to your resource except for connections made from a chosen private endpoint.</li>
            <li>You would use this option if you wanted to have a specific endpoint be the only one allowed to communicate to your AI Service.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deploy a Model</h2>

    <p>Once your resource is created. Click on “Go to Resource”, which will send you to the resource’s overview page. Here you should see a prominent option titled “Explore and Deploy” with a link sending you to <b>Azure OpenAI Studio</b>. The Azure OpenAI studio has a different interface than the Azure portal. Here you will find the option to create a new deployment, and now it’s up to you to choose whichever model best fits your needs (GPT 3.5, GPT 4, etc.). Refer to Table ## in the previous guide if needed. As explained before, there are three main types of text resources: chat, completions, and embeddings. In these mini-guides we will focus on chat. We will talk about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), using the API, and fine tuning. Before continuing, we encourage you to deploy a basic chatbot and explore its functionality in OpenAI Studio.</p>
